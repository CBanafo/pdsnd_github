># Exploring US Bike Share Data
*Using Python programming language, a detailed data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, we uncover the bike share usage patterns by comparing the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.*

### Stats Generated
*Stats were generated from four major aspects*
1. Popular travel times
* most used month
* most commond day used
* most common hour of day used

2. Most used stations
* popular starting station
* most used end station
* best station combinations by number of times used

3. Duration for trips
* average time travel
* total time travel

4. User information
* each gender type by numbers
* youngest individuals involved by each gender
* youngest and oldest user type by gender
